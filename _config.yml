description: 这里的文章排版比较丑，有时间了在慢慢整理，简书上的排版会好很多~~欢迎指出文章中的错误或者不足之处. # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
#  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
 # line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  #Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
